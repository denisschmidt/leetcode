/*

Given a positive integer, output its complement number. 
The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

 
Example 1:
  Input: 5
  Output: 2
  Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
 

Example 2:
  Input: 1
  Output: 0
  Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
 

Note:
  The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
  You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
  This question is the same as 1009: https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/

    } else {
      start = true;
      s.push(bit ^ 1);
