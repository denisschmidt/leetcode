Given Two Strings s1 and s2 containing only lowercase letters of same length. 

The task is to make these strings equal by using the minimum number of operations. 

In one operation you can equalize any letter to any other alphabet.

```
Examples:
  Input: S1 = “abb”, S2 = “dad” 
  Output: 2 
    a -> d 
    b -> a 
  Explanation: 
    Strings after the first operation – 
    S1 = “dbb”, S2 = “ddd” 
    Strings after the second operation – 
    S1 = “ddd”, S2 = “ddd”

  Input: S1 = “bab”, S2 = “aab” 
  Output: 1 
    b -> a 
  Explanation: 
    Strings after the first operation – 
    S1 = “aaa”, S2 = “aaa”
