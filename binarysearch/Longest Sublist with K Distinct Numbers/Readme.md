Given an integer k and a list of integers nums, return the length of the longest sublist that contains at most k distinct integers.

Constraints

0 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums

```
Example 1
  Input k = 2 nums = [0, 1, 2, 1, 0]
  Output 3
  Explanation
    The longest substring with 2 distinct integers is [1,2,1], which has length of 3.

Example 2
  Input k = 1 nums = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  Output 5

Example 3
  Input k = 1 nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
  Output 1
