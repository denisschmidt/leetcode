Given a two-dimensional integer matrix, find the length of the longest increasing path. 

You can move up, down, left, or right.

**Constraints**
  Number of rows in matrix ≤ 500
  Number of columns in matrix ≤ 500

```
Example 1
  Input
    matrix = [
      [1, 3, 5],
      [0, 4, 6],
      [2, 2, 9]
    ]
  Output
    6

  Explanation
    The longest path is [0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9]
```
