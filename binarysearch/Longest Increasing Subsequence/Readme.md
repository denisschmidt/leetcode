Given an unsorted list of integers nums, return the longest strictly increasing subsequence of the array.

Bonus: Can you solve it in O(NlogN) time?

Constraints: n â‰¤ 1,000 where n is the length of nums

```
Example 1
  Input nums = [6, 1, 7, 2, 8, 3, 4, 5]
  Output 5
  Explanation Longest increasing subsequence would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Example 2
  Input nums = [12, 5, 6, 25, 8, 11, 10]
  Output 4
  Explanation One longest increasing subsequence would be [5, 6, 8, 11]
