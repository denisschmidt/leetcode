Given a binary tree root, return the largest absolute difference between any node and its subchild.

For example, given the following tree:

   0
  / \
 4   2
    / \
   1   7
  / \
 6   3

return 7 since the largest absolute difference is between nodes 7 and 0.

```
Example 1
  Input root = [9, null, [0, null, null]]
  Output 9
