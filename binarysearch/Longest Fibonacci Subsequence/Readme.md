You are given a list of strictly increasing positive integers nums. 

Return the length of the longest subsequence A of length at least 3 such that A[i] = A[i - 1] + A[i - 2] for all i > 1.

**Constraints**
  n â‰¤ 1,000 where n is the length of nums

```
Example 1
  Input nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  Output 4
```

**Explanation** 
  We can pick [1, 2, 3, 5].
