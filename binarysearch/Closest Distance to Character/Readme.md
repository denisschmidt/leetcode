Given a string s and a character c, return a new list of integers of the same length as s where for each index i its value is set the closest distance of s[i] to c. 

You can assume c exists in s.

**Constraints**
  n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of s

```
Example 1
  Input
    s = "aabaab"
    c = "b"

  Output
    [2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
```
