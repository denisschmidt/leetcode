Given a binary tree root, return the sum of each of the diagonals in the tree starting from the top to bottom right. 

For example, given

   1
  / \
 4   2
    / \
   5   3
  / \
 7   6

Return [6, 15, 7] since the diagonals are:

1 -> 2 -> 3
4 -> 5 -> 6
7

```
Example 1
  Input root = [1, [2, null, null], [3, null, null]]
  Output [4, 2]
