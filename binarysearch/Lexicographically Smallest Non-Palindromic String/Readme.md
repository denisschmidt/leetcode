You are given a lowercase alphabet string s that is a palindrome. 

Update one character such that s is no longer a palindrome and is lexicographically smallest.

**Constraints**
 2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 where n is the length of s

```
Example 1
  Input
    s = "racecar"
    Output "aacecar"
```

**Explanation**
  We can change the first "r" to "a" to get the lexicographically smallest string that is not a palindrome.
